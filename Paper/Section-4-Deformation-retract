The aim of this section is to prove the results of simplicial homotopy theory necessary to interpret
the rule for $\Pi$-types in~\cref{tab:Pi-types}.

In order to interpret the formation rule, we should consider a fixed cofibrant Kan complex~$X$ and a Kan fibration with cofibrant domain $p \co A \to X$  and define an operation mapping a Kan fibration with cofibrant domain $q \co B \to A$  to a new Kan fibration with cofibrant domain~$\widetilde{\Pi}_p(q) \co \widetilde{\Pi}_A(B) \to X$. For this, we proceed
in two steps. Given a map $q \co B \to A$ as above, we first apply the dependent product functor along $p$, 
\[
\Pi_p \co \SSet_{/A} \to \SSet_{/X} \, , 
\]
to $q \co B \to A$ and obtain a map $\Pi_p(q) \co \Pi_A(B) \to X$, which we will show to be again a Kan fibration. Since this Kan fibration does not seem to have  cofibrant domain in general, we then apply a
cofibrant replacement in $\SSet_{/X}$ to $\Pi_p(q) \co \Pi_A(B) \to X$ so a map with all the desired
properties. 

Below, we will show that, for a Kan fibration $p \co A \rightarrow X$ with cofibrant domain, the dependent product along $p$ preserves Kan fibrations, without assuming $X$ to be a cofibrant Kan complex. By adjointness, this is equivalent to showing that its left adjoint, \ie 
 pullback along $f$, preserves trivial cofibrations. This amounts to proving a restricted version of the Frobenius property~\cite{BergB:topsmi}, obtained by considering pullbacks along Kan fibrations with
cofibrant domain rather than general Kan fibrations. As we will see, some of these assumptions are essential in our
setting.  

Our proof of the restricted Frobenius property follows essentially~\cite{gambino2017frobenius}. 
In order to combine our development with that argument, however, we need to know that the notion of a Kan fibration considered here coincides with the one considered in~\cite[Definition~4.1]{gambino2017frobenius}. For this, 
we use the pushout product $\kcyl \hattimes f$ of an endpoint inclusion $\kcyl \co \braces{ k } \to \Delta[1]$ and a map~$f \co Y \to X$, which is defined as the unique dotted arrow  in the diagram:
\[
\xymatrix{
\braces{ k } \times Y \ar[r] \ar[d] &  \Delta[1]  \times X  \ar[d] \ar@/^1.5pc/[ddr] \\
\braces{ k} \times X \ar[r]  \ar@/_1.5pc/[drr] & \big( \Delta[1] \times Y ) \cup X \ar@{.>}[dr]  \\
 & &\Delta[1] \times  X \, .}
 \]



\begin{proposition} For a map $p \co B \to A$, the following conditions are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
\item The map $p$ is a fibration.
\item The map $p$ has the right lifting property with respect to the pushout products 
$\kcyl  \hattimes f$, where $k \in \braces{ 0 \, , 1 }$ and $f \co Y \to X$ is a cofibration.
\item The map $p$ has the right lifting property with respect to the pushout products $\kcyl  \hattimes h_n^i$, 
where $k \in \braces{ 0 \, , 1 }$ and $h_n^i \co \Lambda^i[n] \to \Delta[n]$  is a horn inclusion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof}The proof of \cite[Theorem~3.2.3]{joyal-tierney:simplicial-homotopy-theory} is completely constructive and sufficient to imply this result.
For more details, readers may also refer to~\cite[Corollary~5.3.2]{henry2018wms}
and \cite[Proposition~5.2.6]{henry2018wms}.
\end{proof}



Let $p \co A \rightarrow X$ be a fibration with cofibrant domain. In order show that $p^* \co \SSet_{/X} \to \SSet_{/A}$ preserves 
trivial cofibrations, as required,  we follow closely \cite[Section~3]{gambino2017frobenius}. Note that we cannot apply directly the result therein since 
the assumption that every object is cofibrant does not hold in our setting. However, only minor modifications are sufficient.


% \begin{lemma} \label{thm:missing-1}
% \hfill 
% \begin{enumerate}[(i)] 
% \item $\mathcal{J} \subset \Cof \cap \mathcal{S}$.
% \item $\Cof \cap \mathcal{S} \subseteq \TrivCof$.
% \end{enumerate}
% \end{lemma} 


\begin{definition} \label{def:strhtpyequiv} Let $k \in \braces{0 \, , 1 }$.
A map $f \co Y \rightarrow X$ in $\SSet$ is a \myemph{strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalence} if there are maps $H$ and $H_X$ which exhibit $f$ as a retract of $\delta^k \times ' f$ as follows:

\[
\xymatrix@C=2cm{
Y \ar[d]_{f} \ar[r]^-{\delta^{1-k} \times Y} & 
( \Delta[1] \times Y ) \cup X \ar[d]^{\delta^k \times' f} \ar[r]^-{H_X} & 
Y \ar[d]^{f} \\
X \ar[r]_-{\delta^{1-k} \times X}  & 
\Delta[1] \times X \ar[r]_{H} &
X  }
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark} \label{rem:below-strhtpyequiv}
The definition of strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalence in~\cref{def:strhtpyequiv} is equivalent to the one given in \cite{gambino2017frobenius} by Lemma~3.3 therein.
With the definition given here, it is immediate to observe that a cofibration which is a strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalence is a trivial cofibration. Indeed, if $f \co Y \to X$ is a cofibration then $\delta^k \times ' f$ is 
a weak equivalence by the pushout-product property and so $f$ is also a weak equivalence, since it is a retract of $\delta^k \times ' f$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:genTcof_strongHequiv} \hfill 
\begin{enumerate}[$(i)$]
\item For $k < n$, the horn inclusions $h_n^k \co \Lambda^k[n] \rightarrow \Delta[n]$ are strong $0$-oriented homotopy equivalences,
\item For $0 < k$, the horn inclusions $h_n^k \co \Lambda^k[n] \rightarrow \Delta[n]$ are strong $1$-oriented homotopy equivalences.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This is shown as part of~\cite[Theorem 3.2.3]{joyal-tierney:simplicial-homotopy-theory}. The proof given there can be easily checked to be constructive. 
\end{proof}

%I've only added the reference to my paper to avoid having Joyal and Tierney's notes as unique reference for this. But If you think it is fine, you can remove it.



\begin{lemma} 
\label{lemma:pb_of_StrongHomotopyEq}
Let $p \co A \rightarrow X$ be a fibration with cofibrant domain. Then, for $k \in \{0,1\}$, 
$p^* \co \SSet_{/X} \to \SSet_{/A}$ preserves strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalences.
\end{lemma}



\begin{proof} This is essentially \cite[Lemma~3.7]{gambino2017frobenius}, but we provide some details
for the convenience of our readers.
Let $f \co Y \rightarrow X$ be a strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalence. Let $H$ and $H_X$  maps 
as in~\cref{def:strhtpyequiv}. Let us consider the pullback
\[
\xymatrix@C=1.5cm{
A[f] \ar[r]^-{p^*(f)}  \ar[d]_{p_{A[f]}} & A \ar[d]^{p} \\
Y \ar[r]_{f} & X \, .\\
}
\] 
To show that $p^*(f)$ is a strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalence, we let $K \co \Delta[1] \times A \rightarrow A$ be a diagonal filler in the square:
\[
\xymatrix@C=1.5cm{
A \ar[d]_{\delta^{1-k}} \ar@{=}[rr] & & A \ar[d]^p \\ 
\Delta[1] \times A \ar[r]_{\Delta[1] \times p}  & \Delta[1] \times X \ar[r]_H & X
}\]
Where the map on the left-hand side is a trivial cofibration because $A$ is a cofibrant.
It remains to construct a map $K_Y$  fitting into a retract diagram of the form
\[
\xymatrix@C=1.5cm{
A[f]  \ar[d]_{p^*(f)} \ar[r] &  (\Delta[1] \times A[f])  \cup Y \ar[d]^{\delta^k \times' p^*(f)} \ar[r]^-{K_Y} & A[f] \ar[d]^{p^*(f)} \\
A \ar[r] & \Delta[1]  \times A \ar[r]_-{K} & A
}
\]
We define it using the universal property of $A[f]$ as the unique map to $A[f]$ such that the image in $X$ is the one specified by the diagram above, and the value in $Y$ is the one given by $H_X$ composed with the map $(\Delta[1] \times A[f]) \cup Y$ to $(\Delta[1] \times A[f]) \cup X$. These indeed have the same image in $X$ exactly because of the commutation of lower triangle in the filler diagram defining~$H'$. With this definition, the commutation of the diagram and the fact that the upper line is a retract are immediate.
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}\label{prop:Frobenius}
Let $p \co A \rightarrow X$ is a fibration with cofibrant domain. Then the pullback functor 
\[
p^* : \SSet_{/X} \rightarrow \SSet_{/A}
\] 
preserves  trivial cofibrations.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof} Since the pullback functor $p^*$ has a right adjoint,  it is enough to check that the pullback of a generating trivial cofibration is a  trivial cofibration. For trivial cofibrations, note that the trivial cofibrations in $\SSet_{/X}$ are generated by the horn inclusions $h^k_n \co \Lambda^{k}[n] \rightarrow \Delta[n]$ for all possible choices of $x \co \Delta[n] \rightarrow X$. By \cref{lemma:genTcof_strongHequiv} they are all strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalences. Moreover, their pullback to $A$ is also their pullback along the map $A \times_X \Delta[n] \rightarrow \Delta[n]$ which is again a fibration with cofibrant domain by \cref{lem:cofibrant_fiber_product}. Hence  \cref{lemma:pb_of_StrongHomotopyEq} implies that the pullback 
to~$A$ are also strong $k$-oriented homotopy equivalences. Since they are cofibrations, they are 
trivial cofibrations by \cref{rem:below-strhtpyequiv}.
\end{proof}



\begin{theorem}\label{cor:Pi_types_are_fibrant}
Let $p \co A \rightarrow X$ be a fibration with cofibrant domain. The dependent product $\Pi_p \co \SSet_{/A} \to \SSet_{/X}$ preserves  fibrations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $p^*$ preserves  trivial cofibrations, its right adjoint $\Pi_p$ preserves fibrations.
\end{proof}





% \begin{theorem} 
% \label{thm:restricted-frobenius}
% The semi-model structure for Kan complexes on $\SSet$ has the restricted Frobenius condition.
% \end{theorem} 

% \begin{proof}  Since the semi-model structure in which we 
% are working is cofibrantly generated, it is sufficient [TO CHECK] that $p^*$ sends generating trivial cofibrations to trivial cofibrations. So, let $p \co B \to \Delta[n]$ be a fibration, $i \co \Lambda^k[n]
% \to \Delta[n]$ be a horn inclusion, and define $ j \defeq p^*(i)$, given by 
% the pullback diagram
% \[
% \xymatrix{
% \bullet  \ar[r] \ar[d]_j \drpullback & \Lambda^k[n] \ar[d]^{i} \\
% B \ar[r]_-{p} & \Delta[n] }
% \]
% We need to show that $j$ is a trivial cofibration.  
% First, since $i$ is a trivial cofibration, it is in particular
% a cofibration and therefore $j$ is again a cofibration by~\cref{thm:cof-pbk}. Secondly, since~$i \in \cal{J}$,
% by part~(i) of \cref{thm:missing-1}, it is a cofibration and a strong homotopy equivalence. Since its codomain is cofibrant, $j$ is a strong homotopy equivalence by~\cref{thm:missing-2}.
% But now $j$ is both a cofibration and a strong homotopy equivalence
% and hence it is a trivial cofibration, as required, by part~(ii) of \cref{thm:missing-2}.
% \end{proof} 



 


\begin{remark}[$\Pi$-types] \label{rem:pi-types}
We can define the interpretation of $\Pi$-types using~\cref{cor:Pi_types_are_fibrant} and a cofibrant replacement, as follows. 
Recall that, for maps $p \co A \to X$ and $q \co B \to A$,  the dependent product $\Pi_p(q) \co \Pi_A(B)
\to X$ is equipped with a map
\[
\mathsf{app} \co \Pi_A(B) \times_A  A \to B
\] 
in $\SSet_{/A}$ which is universal in the sense that, for every  $Y \to X$, the function
\[
\begin{array}{rcl} 
 \SSet_{/X}[ Y , \Pi_A(B)] & \longrightarrow &  \SSet_{/A}[Y \times_A A, B]  \\
  f & \longmapsto & \mathsf{app}(f \times_A 1_A) 
  \end{array} 
 \]
 is a bijection. This means that we have a function $\lambda$ in the opposite direction such that  
 \begin{equation}
 \label{equ:betaeta}
 \mathsf{app}(\lambda(b) \times_A 1_A) = b   \, , \quad
 \lambda( \mathsf{app}(f \times_A 1_A)) = f \, ,
 \end{equation}
 for every $b \co Y \times_A A \to B$ and $f \co Y \to \Pi_A(B)$.  These equations correspond to the
 well-known judgemental $\beta$-rule and $\eta$-rule for $\Pi$-types, respectively.
 
 When $p$ and $q$ are fibrations and $A$ is cofibrant, the map 
 $\Pi_p(q) \co \Pi_A(B) \to X$ is a fibration by \cref{cor:Pi_types_are_fibrant} but $\Pi_A(B)$ is not cofibrant
 in general. Thus, we interpret  $\Pi$-types as the 
 cofibrant replacement  of $\Pi_A(B)$, which is given by a cofibrant simplicial set
 $\mathbb{L}(\Pi_A(B)$  equipped with
 a trivial fibration $\varepsilon \co \mathbb{L}(\Pi_A(B)) \to \Pi_A(B)$. 
We then define $\widetilde{\mathsf{app}} \co   \mathbb{L}(\Pi_A(B)) \times_A A \to B$ by letting
\[
\widetilde{\mathsf{app}}  \defeq \mathsf{app} \circ (\varepsilon \times_A 1_A) \, .
\]
For a bifibrant simplicial set $Y$ and maps $Y \to X$,  $b \co Y \times_A A \to B$, we define $\widetilde{\lambda}(b) \co Y \to \mathbb{L}(B^A)$ to be the
diagonal filler
\[
\xymatrix{
0 \ar[r] \ar[d] & \mathbb{L}(\Pi_A(B))  \ar[d]^\varepsilon \\
Y \ar[r]_{\lambda(b)} \ar@{.>}[ur] & \Pi_A(B)}
\]
which exists since $Y$ is cofibrant and $\varepsilon$ is a trivial fibration. It follows immediately that
\[
 \widetilde{\mathsf{app}}(\widetilde{\lambda}(b) \times_A 1_A) = b \, ,
\]
so the $\beta$-rule holds as an equality. Instead, for $f \co X \to \mathbb{L}(\Pi_A(B))$, we have a homotopy
\[
\eta_f  \co \widetilde{\lambda}( \widetilde{\mathsf{app}}(f \times_A 1_A)) \sim  f  \, ,
\]
which is constructed as the diagonal filler in the following diagram
\[
\xymatrix@C=2cm{
\partial \Delta[1] \times Y \ar[r]^-{[f, \widetilde{\lambda}(f \times 1_A)]} \ar[d] & \mathbb{L}(\Pi_A(B)) \ar[d]^\varepsilon \\
\Delta[1] \times Y \ar[r] \ar@{.>}[ur] & \Pi_A(B) }
\]
where the bottom map is the constant homotopy given by the equality in the $\eta$-rule in~\eqref{equ:betaeta}.
\end{remark}
