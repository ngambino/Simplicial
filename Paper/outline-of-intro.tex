\subsection*{Context} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The problem
\item Obstructions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimal fibrations
\item Exponentiability of Kan complexes
\end{itemize}
\item Progress so far:
\begin{itemize}
\item Coquand and others:  
\begin{itemize}
\item cubical sets
\item uniform fibrations
\item issues: de Morgan version is known not to be equivalent to $\mathbf{Top}$.
\end{itemize}
\item Gambino and Sattler
\begin{itemize}
\item General approach; uniform fibrations
\item Gets $\Pi$-types
\item Issue: if you work algebraically, notion of fibration does not support universe; if you work non-algebraically then assumptions are not known to be constructively valid.
\end{itemize}
\item Sattler: 
\begin{itemize}
\item gets a model structure
\item same issues as Gambino-Sattler. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Main results}

\begin{itemize}
\item We build on [Henry 2018]
\item General approach
\item The crucial role of cofibrancy
\item We obtain 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Pi$-types
\item Universe
\item Univalence
\end{itemize}
\item Coherence issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item We consider them seriously
\item But they are a separate issue, left for future work
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
